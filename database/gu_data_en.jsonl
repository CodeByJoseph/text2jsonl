Tentamen med pedagogiskt stöd Det kan finnas flera skäl till att du som student behöver anpassningar vid tentamen. För att beviljas anpassning på salstentamen behöver du ha ett giltigt Nais-besked. Detta gör du genom att ansöka om pedagogiskt stöd på Göteborgs Universitets Studentportal. Om du behöver anpassad tentamen i skrivsal behöver du meddela CSE studievägledning minst fyra veckor innan tentamen. Vänligen läs mer på Inför din anpassade salstentamen vid Göteborgs universitet. När du anmält dig till en tentamen, till vilken du har fått beslut om anpassad examination, måste du meddela studentoffice@cse.gu.se senast 10 dagar innan tentamensperioden. Tentamensanmälan För att kunna tentera måste du vara registrerad på kursen och anmäld till tentamenstillfället. Från hösten 2024 blir du anmäld av CSE Student office till det ordinarie tentamenstillfället om du är registrerad på det aktuella kurstillfället. Vid omtentamen måste du själv anmäla dig i Ladok. Du ansvarar själv för att kontrollera att du är anmäld. Du blir inte insläppt i tentasalen om du kommer dit oanmäld. Inga undantag görs. Observera att varken en administratör eller en examinator kan anmäla dig efter att anmälningstiden gått ut. För mer information, vänligen besök följande länk på Chalmers Studentportal . Tentamensanmälan är obligatorisk för samtliga skriftliga salstentamen vid CSE och sker via Ladok . Vid problem vänligen kontakta CSE:s studieexpedition innan anmälningsperiodens slut. OBSERVERA! Anmälningsperioderna som student vid Göteborgs universitet skiljer sig från Chalmers anmälningsperioder. Om du har glömt att anmäla dig har du INTE möjlighet att skriva tentamen vid det aktuella tillfället. När anmälningsperioden infaller framgår av tabellen nedan.

De ordinarie tentamensperioderna infaller efter varje läsperiods slut och omtentamensperioderna infaller några månader efter. Mer information om tentamensperioder och det akademiska året finns på Chalmers Studentportal . OBS: Undantag kan tillämpas i vissa kurser – om du har frågor om en specifik kurs så är du välkommen att kontakta studieexpeditionen ( studentoffice@cse.gu.se ) eller ansvarig lärare för mer information. Dubbeltentamen Har du två tentor på samma dag och tid? En tenta kan flyttas till för- eller eftermiddagen om en annan tenta är planerad samtidigt och examinator godkänner det.
